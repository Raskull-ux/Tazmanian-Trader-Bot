# This says nothing about market cap. A mega-cap and a mid-cap that both

#   (a) today's volume >= REL_VOLUME_SPIKE_THRESHOLD x its own 20-day average
#       volume, OR
#   (b) |today's return| >= max(MOVE_ABS_FLOOR, MOVE_VOL_MULTIPLE x that

#
# (b) is deliberately volatility-NORMALIZED, not a flat percentage. A flat
# threshold treats every stock the same regardless of how much it normally
# moves, which either misses real outliers in quiet stocks or never fires
# for stocks that are volatile every day. MOVE_ABS_FLOOR exists only so a
# nearly-silent stock doesn't get flagged for a trivial move that happens to
# be "3x" its own near-zero volatility.
#
# A flagged name is promoted into the permanent working universe (see
